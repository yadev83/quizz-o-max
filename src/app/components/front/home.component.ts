            To play the game and start a quizz, it is very simple ! First, click the menu icon and choose the "Play" button.

          <p>
            Doing so will bring up a page containing a form to fill in with parameters for your game. Number of questions, Theme,
            Difficulty : You can customize the quizzes as you wish !
          </p>

            If you like to compete with others, You may want to get the highest score possible ! Score is calculated pretty simply.
            By default, every question has a value of <b>50 points</b>. Hard questions has a value of <b>75 points</b> and easy questions
            weighs <b>25 points</b>. You start the game with the base points given by each question (i.e if playing for 10 normal questions,
            you will start with 500 points) Answering correctly will double the points a question weighs and answering wrongly will remove
            the points that question gave you. (In fact, if you do all wrong you'll end up with 0 points and if you do all right, you'll double
            the number of points you had at the beggining).<br />
            The best way to make a big score is to play on "Any Category" mode because locking a category will reduce the number of points a
            question weighs (to keep it fair). Also pick the "Hard" difficulty mode as it is only made of hard questions that are more valuable.
            And finally, pick a reasonable amount of questions because the more you have, the more possible score you can make, but also the more
            you can fail...
          </p>

            After you are sure with customization of the game, you can click the "Play !" button and the quizz will start. From now,
            it is quite simple : When a question appear on your screen, you must click on the answer you think is the correct one.
            Once you clicked, the right answer is highlighted and you either loose or gain score.
